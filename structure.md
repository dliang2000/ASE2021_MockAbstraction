# main thesis

in three parts:
1. mocks are an important component of test cases
2. anything that works with tests (IDEs, analysis) should deal with mocks
3. we have a good static analysis for finding mocks + it is applicable to existing test analyses (focal methods)

# structure

* introduction: which edits do we need? make consistent with main thesis above
✓ motivating example: is it OK in this context?
  ✓ we do say some applications
  ✓ we could save some space by condensing the declarative, arrays+collections
  ✓ can add more applications from Ghafari
* technique: should probably condense, but let's add all the content first
✓ evaluation ** most of the new work goes here ** <- david has to do this
  ✓ add new content from thesis
  ✓ add applicability of mocks in test coverage
  ✓ application: mocks are important
* related work
  ✓ add work cited by Ghafari
  - look up PC members
* discussion: rework significantly for the new targetting

TODO:
* modify the code to identify "*Mock* and "Mock*" classes as mocks

* introduction
* condense technique
1) related work: look up PC members
2) discussion
