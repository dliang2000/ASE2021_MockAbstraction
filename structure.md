# main thesis

in three parts:
1. mocks are an important component of test cases
2. anything that works with tests (IDEs, analysis) should deal with mocks
3. we have a good static analysis for finding mocks + it is applicable to existing test analyses (focal methods)

# structure

* introduction: which edits do we need? make consistent with main thesis above
* motivating example: is it OK in this context?
  - we do say some applications
  - we could save some space by condensing the declarative, arrays+collections
* technique: should probably condense
* evaluation ** most of the new work goes here **
  - add new content from thesis
  - add applicability of mocks in test coverage
* related work
  - provenance for debugging static analysis
  - look up PC members
* conclusion
