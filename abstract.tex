	Unit testing is a widely used tool in modern software development processes. A well-known issue in writing tests is handling dependencies: creating usable objects for dependencies is often complicated. Developers must therefore often introduce mock objects to stand in for dependencies during testing. 
	
	We believe that the static analysis of test suites, alongside the systems under test, can enable developers to better characterize the behaviours of existing test suites, thus guiding further test suite maintenance. However, because mock objects are created using reflection, they confound existing static analysis techniques. At present, it is impossible to distinguish methods invoked on mock objects from methods invoked on real objects, significantly decreasing the precision of static analyses. Static analysis tools currently cannot determine which dependencies' methods are actually tested, versus mock methods being called.
	
	In this paper, we introduce MockDetector, a technique to identify mock objects. Using a dataflow analysis, it is able to handle common Java mock libraries' APIs for creating mock objects and propagate this information interprocedurally through test cases. Following our observations of tests in the wild, we have added special-case support for arrays and collections holding mock objects. We have implemented our system and present results on a suite of benchmarks using Java mocking libraries.
