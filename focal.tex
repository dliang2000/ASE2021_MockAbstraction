\section{Finding Focal Methods}
\label{sec:focal}

In this section we describe how Ghafari finds focal methods (we can cut and paste from other parts of the text) and how methods2test finds focal methods.

We discuss precision and recall issues.

Is it true that every test has at least one focal method? I can believe that a test may have more than one focal method. Think about what it means to have 0 focal methods.
