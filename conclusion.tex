Comparison of imperative and declarative.

In~\cite{bravenboer09:_stric_declar_specif_sophis_point_analy}, Bravenboer and Smaragdakis point out that:
\begin{quote}
Even conceptually clean program analysis algorithms that
rely on mutually recursive definitions often get transformed
into complex imperative code for implementation purposes.
\end{quote}



\textsc{MockDetector} has demonstrated its capability of correctly identifying and tracing mock objects and containers containing them intra-procedurally in the test cases, in a suite of three benchmarks. It has the potential to be a helper static analysis tool, passing the mock information into existing static analysis frameworks for better call graph analysis. Future work of this project including adding the interprocedual analysis, and gathering results for more benchmarks.
